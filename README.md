# MCT-Booking-App

The code for Deliverable 6 includes changes to the patient intake form:  
1. patientform.html: UI changes   
2. patientform.js: Bug fixes, email subscription feature, and training signup feature   

Since this is a static page, you can open the html file in your web browser (e.g. Chrome) and interact with it. The data in a submitted form will be stored in an AWS S3 database.
