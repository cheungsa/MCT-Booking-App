The code for Deliverable 7 includes changes to the patient intake form:   
1. patientform.js: Bug fixes    
2. Deleted unneccessary files

Since this is a static page, you can open the html file in your web browser (e.g. Chrome) and interact with it. The data in a submitted form will be stored in an AWS S3 database.
